Build
=====

        make #will compile the library, ddoc and imports and put it all into "dst" directory

        make test #will compile a test application demostrating the typical use of the library and put it into "dst" directory

Please note that I compiled ab.signal library only under Linux + GNU Make and I did not write any makefiles for other OSs,
but I don't see any reason the ab.signal could not work under other OSs.

****

Example
=======

You can build ab.signal test application and use it as an example of how to use ab.signal.

        make test #will build the test application

Sources for test application are in the ab.test package.
